Stockfish
=========

Stand alone chess computer with Stockfish and DGT Board

This branch supports a pure python implementation with the pyfish engine (taken from the pyfish branch).

It also supports the piface.

To run on the piface and desktop:

1. Go to the py/ folder
2. Do this one time: https://github.com/piface/pifacecad
2. Also do this one time: "sudo pip install -r requirements.txt" 
2. Execute "python pycochess.py"
3. Fixed time modes should work now (with occasional issues).
